<p>In this lesson, we will be going deeper into the expansion cards that can be plugged into motherboards. We will focus on the installation of a video card. It is important to note that the same principles for installing a video card will apply to installing any expansion card. Next, we will cover the central processing units from two major manufacturers: Intel and AMD. Finally, we will review the storage devices that our computers can use.</p>
<p>Expansion Slots<br/>Expansion cards are used to increase and expand a computer’s capability. We can add cards that perform a variety of functions, such as adding more USB, serial, or parallel ports. Communication-based cards can also expand the feature set of the computer through adding a modem or network card. Users who want to play more games may find it useful to add a new video card with better graphics capabilities. Users trying to conserve space could add a TV tuner expansion card to allow the computer to act like a TV to watch cable and record shows like a DVR. Most commonly, though, expansion slots are used to add new ports and features that were not originally available when the computer was made, such as eSATA, FireWire, or USB 3.0 ports.</p>
<p>PCI/PCI-X Slots<br/>An expansion slot is a receptacle on the motherboard for expansion cards. The first expansion slot we will discuss is the oldest covered by the CompTIA A+ hardware exam: the peripheral component interconnect (PCI). PCI was originally developed in the early 1990s to provide an expansion slot for network, video, audio, I/O (input/output), modem, and storage host adapter cards. It replaced older technology, such as the industry standard architecture (ISA) card, as a faster and more robust expansion card slot. It was found as a 32-bit interface supporting a maximum bus speed of 33 MHz. Later, it also offered a 64-bit variety at a speed of 66 MHz, but even this was not fast enough for the growing demand of faster CPUs. Along came the upgrade, called PCI-X, which is a faster, 64-bit version running at a bus speed of 133 MHz. This PCI-X, which is found on modern computers that still have a PCI/PCI-X slot, is fully backward compatible with older PCI cards, but if you mix them with newer PCI-X cards, the motherboard defaults back to the slower PCI speeds. The latest version, PCI-X 2.0 supports speeds of up to 266 MHz to 533 MHz, but has been replaced by the PCIe (PCI express) card slot standards for better speed/performance.</p>
<p>PCI supports a 32- or 64-bit I/O bus providing compatibility with both 486 and Pentium machines. Here are some facts about this slot:</p>
<p>This bus is processor independent (the CPU and the PCI bus can process concurrently).<br/>PCI is plug-and-play, meaning that newly installed devices can be detected and configured automatically.<br/>PCI buses are most commonly used for devices such as sound cards, modems, network cards, and storage device controllers.<br/>The PCI bus is usually 32 bits wide, although 64-bit versions have been used as well. Running at 33 MHz, it can transfer data at 133 MBps (or 266 MBps for 64-bit versions).<br/>PCI is an I/O bus that supports both 32- and 64-bit data paths and has been a standard expansion bus since the Intel 80486 (1989) chipset through all versions of Pentium, Apple Computers, and AMD chipsets. While PCI is definitely a legacy architecture, being replaced by PCIe and Thunderbolt interfaces, it is still included on current mainboards and definitely found in service in most computer workstations.</p>
<p>Summary<br/>The PCI bus runs independently of the System bus, which allows faster access times for peripheral devices using the expansion card.<br/>PCI is PnP in both the BIOS and modern Operating Systems (WinXP +, Linux, and Apple).<br/>Common PCI bus expansion cards include sound cards, USB cards, Firewire cards, network cards, storage device controller (SCSI) cards, and modem cards.<br/>PCI versions originally used 32-bit and eventually 64-bit data paths with the following speeds:<br/>133 MB/s (32-bit at 33 MHz – the standard configuration)<br/>266 MB/s (32-bit at 66 MHz or 64-bit at 33 MHz)<br/>533 MB/s (64-bit at 66 MHz)</p>

<p>Since PCI was too slow for the newest 3D games that were becoming available in the late 1990s, a new standard port, dedicated to graphics, was needed. In 1996, the advanced graphics port (AGP) was announced and was embraced by 3D gamers for their high-speed video needs. It originally was introduced as a 1x variety, but as faster speeds were needed other varieties were added, including 2x, 4x, and 8x AGP. Each variety uses a different amount of power, as shown in the table below.</p>
<p><img alt="image2.png (388×259)" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH07/webcontent/PCH07/image2.png"/></p>

<p></p>
<p>AGP was dominant for a long period of time, but the introduction of PCIe (PCI express) ultimately led to a large decline in popularity, because PCIe speeds were able to outperform AGP and provide a singular slot type for all devices.</p>
<p>Motherboards that provide AGP support have a single AGP slot. Several different versions of AGP have been implemented over the years:</p>
<p>AGP 1.0 1x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 266 MBps.<br/>AGP 1.0 2x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 533 MBps.<br/>AGP 2.0 4x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 1066 MBps.<br/>AGP 3.0 8x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 2133 MBps.</p>

<p>PCI Express (PCIe) Expansion Slots<br/>PCIe (PCI express) began replacing PCI, PCI-X, and AGP by 2005. Five slot sizes are available for PCIe: x1, x2, x4, x8, and x16. While x8 is an official standard, it is not very common and hard to find on both motherboards and cards. The two most common PCIe cards are the x1 and x16. PCIe x1 was designed to replace the old PCI cards for networking, modems, audio, input/output, and other needs by connecting to the southbridge. PCIe x16, on the other hand, focused on replacing AGP and PCI-X for high-speed graphics cards, and connects to the northbridge. Most motherboards support numerous types of PCIe, with several x1 and either one or two x16 card slots available. Notably, a smaller PCIe card can fit into larger PCIe slots, but not vice versa. For example, a PCIe x2 can fit into a PCIe x8, but a PCIe x8 cannot fit into a PCIe x2.</p>
<p>PCIe is considered the next generation I/O bus architecture. Rather than a shared bus, each PCIe slot links to a switch that prioritizes and routes data through a point-to-point dedicated connection and provides a serial full-duplex method of transmission. There are different versions of PCIe slots. The maximum number of lanes that can be assigned to the card inserted into the slot is based upon the card’s version. Basic PCIe provides one lane for transmission (x1), at a transfer rate of 250 MBps. It can also provide multiple transmission lanes (x2, x4, x8, x16, x32). Newer versions of PCIe can transfer data at an even higher rate per lane:</p>
<p>PCIe Version 1: 250 MBps<br/>PCIe Version 2: 500 MBps<br/>PCIe Version 3: 1 Gbps<br/>PCIe Version 4: 2 Gbps</p>
<p><br/>PCIe cards are designated both by size and bandwidth capability. For example, a card may be identified as “single-lane (x1) PCIe with throughput up to 2 Gbps”, which would indicate this card is an x1 size card, and a version 4 card, based on its data transfer rate. Note that “Gbps” refers to “gigabits per second,” the measurement of the rate of data transfer. This should not be confused with a “GB” or “gigabyte,” which refers to the storage capacity of a device. The amount of data lanes in a connection represents the amount of bandwidth between the card and the host: more lanes equals more bandwidth. PCIe x32 cards offer maximum bandwidth, but they are rarely used because of their size.</p>

<p><br/>In addition to greatly increased speed, PCIe offers higher-quality service. PCIe is backwards compatible and allows legacy PCI technology to be run in the same system (i.e. you can have both PCIe and PCI buses in the same system). PCIe buses are most commonly used for video cards in modern computer systems, although nearly any other device can be designed for a PCIe slot.</p>
<p>Small form factor computers, such as laptops or micro-ATX systems, might include a mini-PCI slot. Mini-PCI devices are small cards with either 100 or 124 pins. A typical use for a mini-PCI slot is to add internal cards (such as wireless cards and cellular cards) to laptops.</p>

<p><br/>AMR and CNR Slots</p>
<p><br/>The audio modem riser (AMR) card is a specific type of card used to fit additional cards into a compact space. In the photo below, you can see the vertical circuit board plugged into the motherboard, then a PCIe x1 card connected horizontally to it. This vertical card is a riser card. The AMR allows for analog modems and audio connectors to be used on a riser card. The communications network riser (CNR) has largely replaced the AMR, and allows for six-channel digital audio, networking functions, and other high-quality integrated audio support on a riser card. All of these riser cards are proprietary and bundled with the motherboard when originally purchased from the manufacturer. You cannot use a riser card from one manufacturer with another’s motherboard; they are not interchangeable. They were designed to allow for more expansion devices in a smaller amount of space.</p>

<p>The central processing unit is also known as a CPU or processor. Processors come in two main architectures: 32-bit and 64-bit. We denote 32-bit processors (or applications designed for these processors) as x86. The 64-bit processors and applications are denoted as x64. You can purchase a CPU from either Intel or AMD and it could be x86 or x64, as both companies make both types. The x64 processors allow for larger file sizes, more memory, and complicated programs to run faster and more efficiently. There are three things that differentiate CPU types: 1) socket type (which CPU will fit in which socket); 2) single or multicore design; and 3) the size of its cache. While Intel and AMD are fully compatible in terms of running the Windows operating system, you must actually get the correct software for your type of CPU if you are running UNIX/Linux.</p>

<p>Intel has been making processors for a long time and their contemporary processors all use the land grid array (LGA) socket style. LGA uses spring-loaded “lands” that connect with the bottom of the processor and a hinged clamp mechanism to hold the processor onto the motherboard. The heat sink is then snapped into the mounting holes at the four corners of the processor socket.</p>

<p>Intel processors are broken into families of processors, such as the LGA 775, which contains the Pentium 4, Pentium D, Celeron, Core 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad, and Core 2 Extreme. You should be familiar with the names of the various Intel families, such as Pentium, Celeron, Core, and Sandy Bridge. If you are asked if a certain processor is Intel or AMD, you need to be able to make this determination by the name of the processor alone. All the Intel processors you are asked about in the A+ exam have something in common: two repeated digits. If you see a family name such as LGA 1156, you know it is Intel because the number “1” is repeated in the array number. LGA 1366 has a double “6.” This holds true for all the processors asked about in the A+ exam.</p>
<p>Common Intel land grid arrays:</p>
<p>LGA 775 – Pentium 4, Pentium D, Celeron, Core 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad, Core 2 Extreme<br/>LGA 1366 – Core i7 9xx, Xeon series<br/>LGA 1156 – Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 (not 9xx)<br/>LGA 1155 – Sandy Bridge Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 (second-generation)</p>

<p>AMD usually uses letters in their naming convention, except for the 940 series. Note “940” does not have double repeating digits. Therefore, you can tell it is not an Intel processor and, instead, it is an AMD processor. All the other families you need to know for the exam are listed with letters: AM2, AM2+, AM3, AM3+, and FM1. AMD also uses a different socket style called the pin grid array (PGA). The pins on the back of the CPU connect to the processor socket with a zero insertion force (ZIF) mechanism. The heat sink clips onto mounting lugs on two sides of the processor instead of the four corners used by Intel. All AMD sockets are PGA, except the “F” family.</p>

<p>Overclocking<br/>Overclocking is the process of running a processor, component, or bus at speeds higher than normal design specifications allow. This can be configured in the BIOS of the machine, if supported. This is a very dangerous practice, since it leads to system instability that causes crashes and higher error rates. Additionally, overclocking components makes them run hotter, which can damage them and shorten their lifespan. More power is consumed in overclocking, which creates more heat, and requires more cooling. It is not recommended to overclock your machine for most users, and should never be used in production (work) machines. Overclocking is highly popular in the gaming community, and requires specialized cooling systems to be in place, such as liquid cooling.</p>
<p>Choosing a Processor<br/>So which socket and processor is better: Intel or AMD? It depends on the user. For most users, they are fairly equivalent. But high-end gamers who like to overclock their machines tend to select AMD because it allows for more overclocking than the Intel systems.</p>
<p>CPU Cache<br/>The CPU is more than just the processor — it also contains cache memory. This is a very small amount of memory that provides the fastest memory available to the CPU. Most CPUs have a level 1 and level 2 cache, but some even have a level 3 cache. Because the processor operates so quickly, we want the most-frequently-used information to end up in the cache to speed up the processing. When the processor needs information, it first checks the location “closest” to it (level 1 cache). If the information is not in the level 1 cache, the CPU then checks level 2, then level 3. If the information is not in either of those cache levels, the CPU then reaches out to the system RAM (the next fastest location), and if the information is not there, the CPU then looks to the hard disk drive (the slowest location). By continually trying to find the information closer and more quickly, the processor operations are sped up.</p>
<p>System performance is improved through the use of cache memory, by enabling the processor to use recent memory locations (cache) rather than retrieving information from main memory.</p>
<p>The bottom line when it comes to cache and performance — larger cache results in faster CPU performance.</p>
<p>Earlier, we mentioned the various types of expansion cards; now we are going to focus on video/graphics cards. Video cards come in many varieties, and are sold under numerous different naming conventions, like graphics cards, graphics accelerator cards, or graphics adapters. These cards are add-on cards that create the images you see on the display/monitor. They can come in a variety of expansion card types to fit into the various expansion slots, such as PCI express (PCIe) that is currently dominant, advanced graphics port (AGP), or the older PCI slots. While many low-end desktops come with an integrated graphics chip in the CPU instead of using a dedicated card, this is not suitable for 3D games or CAD/CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) workstations. Therefore, many users will opt to use an add-on graphics card, like the one displayed below, to improve their gaming performance.</p>
<p><img alt="image12.png (289×192)" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH07/webcontent/PCH07/image12.png"/></p>

<p>Video cards contain a very strong processor called a graphics processing unit (GPU) which performs the extensive mathematical calculations involved in rendering the 3D images that most games require. This extensive processing creates a lot of heat. So, properly cooling the graphics card is essential. Many cards, especially lower-powered ones, will use a passive heat sink for quiet operations, or will rely on the case fans to remove the heat. Most modern graphics cards actually use dedicated cooling fans and heat shrouds for better cooling, but they are much noisier due to the fans involved, and often required external power. The image above shows an example of a video card with an enclosed shroud and active cooling fan to draw the heat away from the card.</p>
<p>Installing video cards is very similar to installing any other expansion card. First, you must go into the BIOS and ensure the slot is enabled (AGP or PCIe x16). This may require some configuration changes, such as the AGP speed, turning off the onboard graphics chip, or adjusting the graphics memory size. Next, you will want to power off the machine, remove the power, use proper ESD precautions, and install the new expansion cards into the proper slot. Next, cable the monitor to the card, plug the computer back into the outlet, and turn on the computer. Once the computer boots into the operating system, you will need to install the device drivers to ensure the operating system can provide the best graphics available from your new card.</p>
<p>Video Output<br/>Video output comes in various types of connectors based on the motherboard’s chipset or the graphics card’s chipset. The standard that has been used for the past few decades is the VGA (video graphics adapter), which is a DB-15 style connector. VGA relies on providing a good-quality analog output to a traditional computer monitor. The port for this connector is the blue one on the left in the image below.</p>
<p> <img alt="image13.png (391×113)" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH07/webcontent/PCH07/image13.png"/></p>

<p>The next connector port, shown in white in the middle of the photo above, is called DVI, or digital video interface. It comes in DVI-D (for digital output only), or DVI-I (for integrated output that can provide digital or analog output) varieties. A DVI-I connector can be used with an adapter to operate with a traditional VGA monitor in analog mode, as well.</p>
<p>The third connector, shown on the right of the image, is an HDMI, or high-definition multimedia interface, connection. HDMI comes with three standard connector types: type A (standard), C (mini), and D (micro). Although there is a designation for a type B, it has not been adopted by any manufacturers at this time. Version 2.0 supports 4K UHD and HDR-enabled devices. Micro HDMI has been largely adopted by the mobile telephone market and is included on almost all current models. The special thing about HDMI is that it isn’t limited to carrying just video, but instead carries both audio and video over a single HDMI cable. HDMI is fully digital and doesn’t support analog displays.</p>
<p>Another connector is DisplayPort, which has two form factors, as shown in the images below. DisplayPort was designed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). Mini DisplayPort was a standard announced by Apple in 2008 and adopted by VESA in 2009 to be included in version 1.2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#1.2).</p>
<p>This makes it an ideal interface connector for laptops and mobile devices, similar to HDMI mini. It is also similar to HDMI in that it supports both video and audio with resolutions up to 3840x2160, which can support 4K UHD. DisplayPort can be found on IBM-clone (PC) machines and is gaining traction in the marketplace on mobile devices as well.</p>

<p>Component/RGB (red green blue) is another high-definition connector type, but provides its output in analog format and only up to 720p of resolution. This was commonly used by VCR and DVD players, to connect to television sets, but can sometimes be found on older computers as a secondary output connector. Using RCA connectors, component video actually requires three connectors to pass the video signal to the TV, each one with a different colored label of red, green, and blue. Audio signals require separate patch cords.</p>
<p><img alt="image15.jpeg (600×450)" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH07/webcontent/PCH07/image15.jpeg"/></p>

<p>S-video is a very old type of connection that was originally used to connect video cameras and VCRs to televisions. They provide a resolution of up to 480p in analog signal only. They are often labeled as “TV out” on older computer systems, and are used only as a secondary display output.</p>
<p><img alt="image16.jpeg (640×480)" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH07/webcontent/PCH07/image16.jpeg"/></p>

<p>Finally, we have the oldest type of video interface, Composite Video. This is by far the lowest quality output of all the types we have discussed. This cable also uses RCA connectors with an output of 480p. This cable combines all the video signals over a single RCA cable, usually labeled as “video,” and the connector itself is yellow. The Composite Video cable operates in analog signal only with the audio signal separate as well. Composite differs from Component in that audio cable are bundled together with the Composite Video (Red, White, Yellow), whereas, Component uses a total of five cables (Red, Green, Blue for video and the standard Red and White for audio).</p>

<p>In the lab below, you should install an expansion video card. Be sure to use proper ESD precautions so as to avoid damaging fragile components.</p>
<p>As we discussed in a previous module, storage is one function that makes a computer a computer. So, storage devices are a critical component. Storage devices hold all of the bits and bytes that make up the data we process, photographs, music, and more. There are many different types of storage devices used with modern computers, including hard drives, optical drives, and external drives. Some computers still have legacy storage devices such as floppy disks.</p>
<p>Storage Devices: Optical Drives<br/>Optical drives refer to any disk drive that uses optical media, such as CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray disks. Each disk has a different storage capacity due to the different wavelength of light the laser uses to read the disk, with shorter wavelengths enabling more data to be stored in the same physical space. CDs use infrared light, which has a long wavelength. DVDs use a red laser light, a light with a medium wavelength. Blu-ray uses a blue laser light, which has the shortest wavelength. A CD can hold 700 MB of data, or 80 minutes of music, a DVD can hold 4.7 GB on a standard disc and 8.4 GB on a dual-layer disc. Blu-ray disks can hold 25 GB on a standard disk and 50 GB on a dual-layer disc. Most contemporary workstations have a DVD writer, but Blu-ray writers are becoming more common. Also, each successive technology is backward compatible with the others, therefore a Blu-ray player can also read DVDs and CDs. However, a CD or DVD player cannot read a Blu-ray.</p>
<p>The different devices use different nomenclature for their capabilities. A CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, and BD-ROM (Blu-ray) all indicate that the device is a read-only memory (ROM) device. A device that is recordable only once is identified with an “R.” On a CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R or BD-R, the contents of the disc cannot be changed after writing it the first time. The third category of devices are identified as “RW” devices, and known as write-many, write/rewrite, or erasable. This category includes CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, and the BD-RE disc types.</p>
<p>The speed of an optical drive is described using an “X-rating.” The original CD players could read at 1X (one times), or 150 KBps. The 1X speed is the speed at which your audio CD drive plays your favorite song. DVD players operate at 1.385 MBps (so that is the 1X speed for that type of device). Blu-ray players operate at 4.5 MBps. When buying a drive, you will see the rating listed, such as a 52X CD player, which means it operates 52 times as fast as the original 150 KBps, or 7800 KBps, which is 7.8 MBps. The 1X for each device is the equivalent to listening to a music CD, watching a DVD, or watching a Blu-ray movie in a traditional player.</p>
<p>Storage Devices: External Devices<br/>eSATA is an extension of SATA used for external devices. The port looks identical to a regular SATA port and uses the same cables as a SATA port. Using eSATA can be thought of like using an extension cord. It brings the SATA port to the external portion of the computer's case. If your computer doesn’t have an eSATA port, you can purchase eSATA host adapters that fit in an expansion slot, such as a PCIe x1 or PCIe x4. The speed of eSATA can be 3–6 Gbps, which is very comparable to USB 3.0 speeds of 5 Gbps.</p>

<p>Another form of storage is the flash memory card. It is a type of memory that retains its contents without electricity and is very durable. These are commonly used in digital media players, cameras, and USB thumb drives. These cards come in an enormous variety with nearly 50 different types created, but only a few have become common. These common cards include SD, MMC, Memory Stick, and XD. Some computers have built-in readers for these cards with memory slots, but if your computer doesn’t, an external multi-slot card reader can be added by USB for about $10.</p>

<p>USB flash drives are commonplace today and have replaced floppy disks as the removable media of choice. They are small in physical size and large in memory capability, with the ability to store 64 GB or more of data on a single “stick.” They are popular and easy to use, since they don’t require a special card reader, because the USB device has one built-in. They are often formatted with the FAT-16, FAT-32, or exFAT file system and are ready to use straight out of the box. Simply plug the device into an available USB port, the operating system recognizes it, and you can begin copying, deleting, and modifying files.</p>

<p>Storage Devices: Legacy Devices<br/>Floppy disks dominated the removable storage arena until the late 1990s, and now they are nearly extinct in most organizations. While some removable USB thumb drives can store 64 GB or more of data, floppy disks usually only stored 1.44 MB of data. That means a single thumb drive can store the information from more than 60,000 floppy disks! Floppy disks used flexible magnetic media surrounded by a rigid plastic case. The most common floppy (shown in the bottom image) was the 3.5” floppy, which was named based on the diameter of the magnetic media inside the plastic case. It used to be commonplace to find a floppy disk drive on every computer, which was connected using a mini-molex or BERG power cable and a 34-pin internal IDE/PATA cable. Contemporary machines typically do not have these drives, as they have fallen out of favor with the public. If you have a need for a floppy drive, one can be purchased for less than $20 that can connect to your computer using your USB port. Windows always reserves the A:\ and B:\ drives for the floppy disk drive (FDD), even if your system doesn’t have one.</p>
<p><img alt="image21.png (335×210)" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH07/webcontent/PCH07/image21.png"/></p>

<p>The final legacy storage device is the tape drive. Whereas FDDs are completely out of service today, tape drives are still used in some corporate environments. However, cloud computing is a natural solution to replace tape backups in enterprise environments because it not only automates the backup process but sends the data securely offsite. Tape drives were one of the first removable storage devices used to back up system data. Many home users now use external USB hard disks for this purpose, but many enterprise environments still rely on the tape drives, since they can store large amounts of data (up to 3 TB on a single tape), and can have that data easily transferred to a remote facility. Tapes can store data in native (1:1) or compressed (2:1) mode. A tape that can natively store 70 GB, in compressed mode can store 140 GB of data. Most tape drives connect via SCSI ports, but some can be found using IDE/PATA or SATA instead. Also, it is important to remember that if you are using a tape drive system, you must rotate your tapes to prevent them from getting worn out and have a good backup plan. The Tower of Hanoi is a common tape rotation system used by system administrators, and can be helpful in creating your rotational schema.</p>

<p>Hard disk drives (HDDs) are by far the most important storage device used by a personal computer. These drives store all the user’s data files, applications, and operating systems. Whether the drive is internal or external, it is built the same way. Most drives are built from one or more double-sided platters of aluminum or glass that is coated with a magnetic surface. In the first hard drives, users were lucky to store a maximum of 5 MB of data, but now storage space of 500 GB to 3 TB is commonplace in most users’ workstations. Storage has certainly evolved into expansive storage capacities at minimal cost, with excellent performance speeds.</p>

<p>Hard drives are rated on several characteristics beyond the simple measurement of how much storage space they have. Most users will simply pick a drive based on the storage capacity, but the other performance factors can be even more important. If the drive is a SATA device, it can reach data transfer speeds of up to 6 Gbps, but that is dependent on how fast the drive can access the data from the disk. Hard drives have a spin rate, which is measured in rotations per minute (RPM). It is common for hard drives to have a 5400 RPM rate, but more expensive drives have 7200 RPM, 10000 RPM, or even 15000 RPM rates. The faster spin rates are usually found in servers and high-performance gaming systems, but the 7200 RPM drives are becoming more commonplace as prices continue to decline. Hard disks also have an internal buffer or cache. A inexpensive drive may have a buffer of only 8 MB, while a more expensive drive will have 64 MB of buffer. The bigger the buffer, the better the performance, and the faster the data retrieval from the disk.</p>
<p>The newest technology in the storage arena is the solid state drive (SSD). As with most technology, this was fairly expensive when first introduced into the market, but pricing has leveled off and most PC manufacturers offer an SSD solution on new machines.</p>
<p>Initially, in an effort to increase performance, some HDD manufacturers created a hybrid drive, combining a small solid state drive with a large traditional hard disk to give the user increased speed without the enormous cost of solid state drives. These devices are faster than a traditional drive, but not nearly as fast as an SSD.</p>
<p>In addition to hybrid drives, Intel developed the mSata interface for mobile computing. The smaller form factor allows high-capacity SSD storage at the same access speeds by connecting to the SATA host controller.</p>
<p><img alt="image25.png (330×220)" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH07/webcontent/PCH07/image25.png"/></p>

<p>SSDs are intended to replace the traditional hard disk. They are fast and durable, and contain no moving parts. The SSD emulates a traditional hard drive and is often used in netbooks, Ultrabooks, and other lightweight systems, or machines that require fast, quiet performance. Most SSDs come in a 2.5-inch form factor, similar to a laptop hard disk, and use a 2.5-inch to 3.5-inch adapter when being placed in a desktop computer. The SSD can be built using multilevel cell (MLC) to save money, but these tend to be much slower than their more expensive and faster counterpart, the SLC (single level cell). Initially, these drives cost five to ten times as much as an equivalent-capacity traditional hard disk. Market demand and increased production have helped lower the pricing. As of the end of 2015, a 2.5-inch 250 GB SATAIII SSD can be purchased for less than $100, but the same amount of money would purchase a traditional 2 TB HDD. But, they are significantly faster and quieter, since they can access the information directly without having to wait for the hard disk to spin up and find the data on the disk.</p>
<p><img alt="image26.png (320×240)" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH07/webcontent/PCH07/image26.png"/></p>

<p>A redundant array of inexpensive drives (RAID) combines numerous traditional physical hard drives into a single logical disk to provide a faster or more redundant singular drive. RAID 0 (RAID zero) uses at least two drives to act as a single drive, using striping to boost performance. But, if either drive fails, all the data is lost. Therefore, with RAID 0, the user gains speed but does not gain any redundancy. RAID 1 (RAID one) uses at least two drives to act as a single drive, using mirroring to boost redundancy. Every time the drive is written to by the computer, two copies of the information are written (one to each drive). So, if either drive fails, all the data is still accessible and safe on the other drive. With RAID 1 the user gains redundancy, but does not gain any speed.</p>
<p>Since RAID 0 gave us speed with no redundancy, and RAID 1 gave us redundancy with no increase in speed, engineers developed a hybrid of the two called RAID 01 or RAID 10. In RAID 01 or 10, four drives are combined using the striping from RAID 0 with the mirroring from RAID 1 to gain both speed and redundancy. The only problem with this solution is that you lose fifty percent of the storage space (just like we did in RAID 1) to overhead/redundancy. To overcome this, another variant, RAID 5, was established. In RAID 5, at least three drives are required and they operate as a single logical drive. When information is written to the drive, that information is striped across the drives and a parity is also spread across the drives. If a single drive fails, the information can be rebuilt using the existing information and parity information to fill in the missing pieces. Using hot-swappable drives, a bad drive can be removed, a new one inserted, and the RAID rebuilt without any downtime (though a performance loss will occur while the RAID is being rebuilt).</p>

<p>To create a RAID array, the workstation must have either a PATA or SATA hardware controller that supports hardware RAIDs. Some motherboards support these natively, while others will require the user to purchase an expansion card to perform these functions. If your system doesn’t support hardware RAIDs, Windows does support software RAIDs on all systems, but you will lose the benefits of the RAID for the main operating system using this approach.</p>
<p>Hardware RAIDs require at least two hard disks for RAID 0 or RAID 1, at least three disks for RAID 5, and at least four disks for RAID 10 or RAID 01. To create a software RAID, you can use Windows’ disk management software to create the RAIDs for data drives and other partitions.</p>
<p>Computers require several things to function well: a method to receive data input, a method to process data, a way to output data, and a way to store data. Data storage has evolved over the years, but the most common storage mechanism, the hard disk, has been around for more than 35 years. The only real change has been in physical size (they have gotten smaller), logical size (they can store much more data), speed, and connector types. The most common types of connectors are SATA, PATA/IDE, SCSI, floppy, eSATA, FireWire, USB, and network connections, each of which we will discuss.</p>
<p>PATA (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment) has been around since the 1980s, but used to be called IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics). This type of connector uses a cable made up of 40 wires or 80 wires (which supported cable select mode). Both types of cables had 40 pins on each end. The newer-style cables were color-coded, so that the blue connector attached to the motherboard, the black connector attached to the primary (or master) device, and the gray connector attached to the secondary (or slave) device. This connector type was used for hard disk drives, CD drives, DVD drives, and some tape backup drives. Each of these devices has a jumper on it that must be set to “master,” “slave,” or “cable select” mode. “Cable select” eliminated the need to manually assign the master or slave. Each cable could support up to two devices, but only one master or slave device could be used on each cable. The BIOS had to be configured properly before using these devices. In spite of improvements to the EIDE interface using Ultra Direct Memory Access (UDMA), Serial ATA (SATA) is not limited to four devices per channel and has much faster access times.</p>

<p>SATA is the current connection method used for hard disks and optical drives. It is called serial because only a single device can be attached to each cable, and the data is transmitted in serial fashion (one bit at a time). These devices often do not have jumpers, but if they have one, it is used to configure the speed of data transfer or to enable a special feature like spread spectrum clocking . SATA is a peripheral device and is very fast, allowing for speeds of up to 6 Gbps for the newer version, or 3 Gbps for the older versions. The data cable is shaped like an L, with seven pins for data. The power cable is also L-shaped, but has 15 pins. Internal SATA ports can be converted to an eSATA (external SATA) port simply by using a header to connect the internal port.</p>

<p>SCSI, or small computer system interface, supports daisy-chaining of devices (internally or externally) with either seven devices (narrow SCSI) or 15 devices (wide SCSI). Each device in the chain is provided with a Device ID number that is configured using a selector switch, DIP (dual inline package) switch, or jumper block. SCSI is an older technology and has largely been replaced by SATA and eSATA. Narrow SCSI could only support speeds of up to 40 MBps, while wide SCSI could support up to 320 MBps.</p>

<p>When desktops were originally developed, they weren’t designed to allow for hot-swapping of devices. Hot-swapping is the act of adding or removing a device while the computer is still turned on. In the old days, the user would shut the system down, power the workstation off, then connect the device, and turn the machine back on, otherwise the computer wouldn’t recognize the new device. In the late 1990s, the Windows operating system began to allow hot-swapping of devices, which included USB and FireWire. This allowed the user to simply plug in a device, wait a few seconds, and then begin using it to store or retrieve data. Due to this hot-swapping, it is important that users use the “eject drive safely” feature in Windows before unplugging a device, otherwise data loss will occur. SATA/eSATA also support hot-swapping, but only if AHCI (advanced host controller interface) is selected during configuration in the BIOS. If not, the drive will work as if it is an older PATA/IDE device and will not support hot-swapping.</p>
<p><br/>Overview<br/>This module will discuss sources of heat and its effects, along with various ways to cool the CPU and system.</p>
<p>Heat Sources<br/>Heat is generated through thermal radiation as a by-product of electromagnetic movement within the circuits of our computers. The heat is caused by the internal resistance that the electricity encounters as it flows throughout the computer, and this resistance creates enough heat that the computer often becomes very, very hot inside the case. Each component of the computer creates heat at a different rate, depending on the specific operations being performed. For example, the CPU generates the most heat, since it does the greatest number of computations and uses a large amount of electricity. Another common source of heat is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which does an enormous amount of processing when performing calculations required to support 3D graphics, such as those used in video gaming. Often, during gaming, the GPU will actually create more heat than the CPU.</p>
<p>Other sources of heat include the hard disk and the optical disc drive, as the spinning of the disks during the read/write cycle can generate heat from both friction and electricity. Another component of the computer that generates an enormous amount of heat is the PSU, as it transforms AC power into DC power. Because it is such a large heat source, the power supply usually has its own dedicated cooling fan.</p>
<p>Another potential source of heat is the room in which the computer is located. If you are working in a room with a high room temperature, such as 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius), the computer has to remove additional internal heat from the machine due to the environmental conditions of the room.</p>
<p>Heat Effects<br/>If the computer is unable to remove the heat created by the internal components or environmental heat, the BIOS of the computer may instruct intensive applications to slow down, thereby reducing the processing capability of the CPU and minimizing its heat output. Additionally, the BIOS may actually instruct various components to shut down in order to avoid overheating and possible damage to the components. This can cause the entire system to shut down without warning and can occur routinely unless a more efficient cooling system, such as a larger, more efficient fan, is outfitted into the computer. A system shutdown is rather commonplace in machines where overclocking has been performed, or in systems where a cooling fan has become damaged.</p>
<p>Often there is no indication to the end user that an overheating condition is occurring, but even this can have severe consequences. Hard disk drives, CPUs, and GPUs are all sensitive to temperature changes. Hard drives in particular can become irreparably damaged by temperature changes due to the expansion and contraction of device components. This can cause read/write errors, or even a complete failure of the disk drive.</p>
<p>Heat Reduction<br/>There are many ways to reduce the amount of heat generated in a computer, but the most notable way is the use of a heat sink, like the one pictured below in green. A heat sink works to draw heat away from the sensitive components, such as the CPU, GPU, northbridge, and southbridge, through conduction. It then uses the fins to dissipate heat across a wider surface area. A fan usually moves air over the surface to remove the heat from the heat sink and push it out the computer’s exhaust vents on the back of the system. Heat sinks are created out of aluminum alloys or copper, which are soft metals with high heat conductivity.</p>

<p>Modern PCs can create a great deal of heat and require the use of both a heat sink and a cooling fan to aid in airflow and reduce the effect of heat on the nearby components. Case design is important to create good air flow through the case. Just like opening the windows and doors of a house can create a straight-through wind tunnel effect, cases are built to maximize airflow. Also, cables inside the case should be bundled and tucked out of the way to increase airflow and maximize cooling.</p>
<p>Most modern motherboards and BIOS support temperature monitoring and control for the motherboard and its components. The name for this varies depending on manufacturer, but often it is called PC health or temperature monitoring. For motherboards that support overclocking, you can configure the settings in the BIOS to increase or decrease your processing capability, and thereby prevent additional heat from being generated. The CPU has a sensor that monitors its temperature, and the BIOS can increase or decrease the fan speed to control the temperature of the CPU. Remember, though, by reducing the power consumption (and therefore heat), you are also simultaneously reducing the performance of the CPU.</p>

<p>Over the decades, various cooling methods have been introduced, with each one having its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Active Air Cooling<br/>Active air cooling components consist of a fan and a cooling plate (heat sink) made of aluminum or copper. A fan blows fresh air on a heat sink placed over the components that need to be cooled. The heat sink’s fins increase the surface of the metal plate and increase the heat exchange capabilities of the component. The fan blows the air between those fins, making the heat exchange quicker and more efficient, as it rapidly removes the heated air that is produced between the fins. There is only one drawback to active air cooling: the component that generates heat can never be cooled below the ambient room temperature. This is because active cooling uses forced air from the room, and the room air cannot cool a component to a lower temperature than the ambient temperature. These components are very reliable, and the cost of this system is quite affordable.</p>
<p>Passive Air Cooling<br/>Similar to the active air cooling method, passive air cooling uses a heat sink to create a larger cooling surface of a component. The difference lies in the size of the heat sink, though, since passive air cooling relies solely on the size of the fins to reduce the heat. These fins must be large enough and must also have enough space between them so that a natural flow of air can be achieved that will adequately remove the heat. These heat sinks can become quite heavy and require special parts to be fixed over the part to be cooled. Passive air cooling is the most efficient way of cooling in terms of power saving, since it uses no power to operate. The drawback to this method is weight, since heavy and large heat sinks must be fixed over small parts, increasing the total weight of a computer and reducing the usable area inside the case. Additionally, this method doesn’t work well when the ambient temperature is high, because high ambient temperature causes the passive air cooling to become ineffective.</p>
<p><br/>CPU Cooling<br/>In the lab below, you should install a new CPU. For the purpose of this lab, we have removed the computer's case for you. You will also need to apply thermal paste, install the heat sink and install the cooling fan. For the purposes of this lab exercise, you can assume that ESD precautions are in place.</p>
<p>The following steps will enable you to install a case fan. First, you must ensure that your PC is powered off before you install any component in your system. After opening the case, you will need a Phillips head screwdriver in order to remove/install case fans. If you’re replacing a fan, simply remove the old one by unscrewing it from the case and unplugging the cable from the header (or the MOLEX connection, if you have an older system). To mount the new fan, hold the fan up to the mounting position so that the holes for screws line up with the holes in the case. While holding the fan in place with one hand, with your other hand use four screws to secure it in place. Some models use plastic friction clips to hold the fan in place instead of screws. If the system is like this, simply un-snap the clips, remove the fan, and pop the new one in its place.</p>
<p>After you secure the fan, you need to attach the fan to an unused fan header to provide the fan with power. The headers are keyed to ensure a proper connection and prevent you from plugging them in backwards. Four-pin headers will work with three-pin fans, but you will not be able to control fan speeds, since this is only performed by the fourth pin in the connector.</p>
<p>When you are done installing the fan, make sure you route your fan and other cables using proper cable management techniques and some zip-ties. Proper cable management prevents the fans from hitting the cables when they spin and also aids in proper airflow to increase cooling efficiency. Be sure to power up the computer and make sure the fan is working properly.<img alt="image5.png (720×540)" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d826575d0a0001dc3e9f244fa018c560/PCH08/webcontent/PCH08/image5.png"/></p>
